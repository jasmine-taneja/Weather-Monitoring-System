# IoT Weather Monitoring Dashboard

An interactive web dashboard showcasing live temperature and humidity readings. Powered by ThingSpeak and hosted on GitHub Pages.

** Live version**: https://jasmine-taneja.github.io/Weather-Monitoring-System/

---

##  Overview

This project presents a sleek and responsive **web dashboard** that visualizes data from an IoT-based weather monitoring system. The dashboard pulls in data from a ThingSpeak channel (ID: `3056719`) via API, displaying:

- Animated **live values** (latest temperature & humidity)
- Embedded **real-time graphs** from ThingSpeak

This makes it perfect for demonstrations, school projects, or small-scale IoT system monitoring.

##  Live Demo

Once live, the dashboard will display:

- Current **Temperature (Â°C)** and **Humidity (%)**
- Responsive charts embedded directly from your ThingSpeak channel
